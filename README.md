# web3-calendly

Learning a littile bit of web3 from [Part Time Larry](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY2ifv8iH1Dsgjrz-h3lWLQ)

For development, the project is using [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)

Register [Alchemy](https://t.co/OWHgQZMAn8) for the Ethereum node.

Rename `example.hardhat.config.js` to `hardhat.config.js` and fill up private key and goerli with api key from the Alchemy.

You can get eth at [this url](https://goerli-faucet.mudit.blog/)
